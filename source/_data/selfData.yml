short: "Developer & Designer from University of Waterloo"
long: |-
    I was born in Qingdao, Shandong, a modern coastal city in China where the 2008 Olympic sailing games were held. My family later moved to Richmond, BC when I was at the age of 3. Now, I am an undergraduate computer science student at University of Waterloo.
    One of my areas of interests as a CS major is seeking how to make technology look and feel even better than it currently is. I was a gadget lover ever since I was young, which ignited my passion to pursue CS as my career and learn programming. 
    Throughout my growth I have also developed an eye for visuals by being exposed to hobbies such as digital art, graphic design and photography, inspiring me to express creativity through code. I am currently delving in the world of computer graphics and its applications in fields such as game dev and motion design, while interning as a rendering engineer at Microsoft's the Coalition Studio.
